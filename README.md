# geostat

A python library for Geostatistics. This is mainly for people
who want to understand how basic geostatistical algorithms work. 

It can be used for very simple cases, but it does not contain advanced methods.

We tried to make the code as simple and clean as possible.

The most expensive operations are based on numpy and the code is reasonably fast,
however much better using other dedicated and professional software.
